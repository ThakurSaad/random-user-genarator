Welcome to my first ever backend project using <b>Software Architectural Patter</b>. Here I used MVC (Module View Controller). The messy backend code I wrote in the past has become so much pretty that its like a dream. I love <b>MVC</b>. Shout out to <b>Trygve Mikkjel Heyerdahl Reenskaug</b> for inventing such an amazing pattern.
